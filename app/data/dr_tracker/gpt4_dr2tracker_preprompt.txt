"""
Below it will be attached a HTML code form which I need you to extract some information following these rules:

1. The HTML code has information on a report for which I need to extract the content in a structured form. Each entry of this report will be written in a dictionary with the following keys and respective data types:

{
    "report_date": String of the date as mm/dd/yyyy,
	"report_section": String,
	"entry_number": String,
    "reported_location": string,
    "is_update": Boolen (True/False),
	"summary_title": String/Null,
    "summary": String,
    "references": List of list,
    "cited_locations": String/Null
}

2. The date of the report is found in a paragraph tag with the following structure:
	<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:center;
	line-height:normal;background:#D9D9D9'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
	font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>March 7, 2025</span></b></p>

In this example, the key "report_date" would receive "03/7/2025"


3. The sections of the report are defined in paragraph tags such as there:

	<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
	normal;background:#5B9BD5'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
	color:black'>Highlight of the Day</span></b></p>

	<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
	normal;background:#5B9BD5'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
	color:black'>Domestic Events (Media &amp; Officials)</span></b></p>

	<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
	normal;background:#5B9BD5'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
	color:black'>International Events (Media &amp; Officials)</span></b></p>

	<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
	normal;background:#5B9BD5'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
	color:black'>Research, Policies and Guidelines (Media &amp; Officials)</span></b></p>

The assignment of the key "report_section" will be coded as:

	"Highlight of the Day" is coded as "hod"
	"Domestic Events (Media &amp; Officials)" is coded as "dme"
	"International Events (Media &amp; Officials)" is coded as "int"
	"Research, Policies and Guidelines (Media &amp; Officials)" is coded as "rpg"

The section "Highlight of the Day" ("hod") frequently does not have an entry (Nil). Do not include any JSON object when that is the case.

4. If the paragraph tag has a similar structure as this code:

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;
margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:39.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18.0pt;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>1.<span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Ontario: </span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>As of March
12, Toronto Public Health is investigating a <b>measles </b>case linked to Air
Canada Flight AC 002 from Tokyo to Toronto on March 2. Passengers on the flight
and individuals in Terminal 1 from approximately 1650 to 1940 may have been
exposed. This marks the second recent measles exposure at Pearson International
Airport, following a Korean Air flight from Seoul on February 22. (</span><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#0563C1'><a
href="https://example.com/news1"><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:#0563C1'>News Agency A</span></a></span><span

style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#0563C1'><a
href="https://example.com/news2"><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:#0563C1'>Health Organization B</span></a></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>) </span></p>

I need you to return a dictionary with the following structure given the example above:

{
    "report_date": "03/07/2025"
	"report_section": "dme"
	"entry_number": "1",
    "reported_location": "Ontario",
    "is_update": False,
	"summary_title": Null,
    "summary": "As of March 12, Toronto Public Health is investigating a <b>measles</b> case linked to Air Canada Flight AC 002 from Tokyo to Toronto on March 2. Passengers on the flight and individuals in Terminal 1 from approximately 1650 to 1940 may have been exposed. This marks the second recent measles exposure at Pearson International Airport, following a Korean Air flight from Seoul on February 22.",
	"hazard_list": ["measles"],
    "references": [
        ["https://example.com/news1", "News Agency A"],
        ["https://example.com/news2", "Health Organization B"]
    ],
    "cited_locations": Null
}


The key "hazard_list" should be a list as some entries have more than on hazard identified by the bold tag.

IMPORTANT: In the "summary" field, preserve the original bold formatting from the HTML by keeping <b> tags around bolded text exactly as they appear in the source. For example, if the HTML shows "investigating a <b>measles</b> case", the summary should contain "investigating a <b>measles</b> case" with the bold tag intact. Only preserve the first occurrence of each bolded term as it appears in the original HTML.

If "cited_locations" exists, it would be written in a separated paragraph tag, for instance:


<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Cited Locations:</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> Belgium, Democratic
Republic of Congo, France, Germany, South Africa, Uganda, United Kingdom, and
United States.</span></p>

The key "cited_locations" is a list that would contain all geolocations listed. Hence the values for "cited_locations" would be ["Belgium", "Democratic
Republic of Congo", "France", "Germany", "South Africa", "Uganda", "United Kingdom", "United States"].



There are instances in which the entry could be written within list item tags, and should be parsed as a paragraph, for instance:


 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#00B050;margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;
     line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
     color:windowtext'>Uganda (Update):</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:windowtext'> According to media
     reports on March 7, 6 suspected cases of <b>Ebola </b>have been isolated at
     Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda, awaiting test results
     from samples sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute following contact
     with a person who died of Ebola in Ntoroko District. In response,
     authorities in Fort Portal city and surrounding districts have ordered the
     installation of hand-washing facilities, temperature screenings in public
     places, and suspended school visitations for 1 month to reduce transmission.

5. There are cases in which a single "reported_location" is attributed to multiple events, for instance

outside of New York City. Additionally, the case has no connection to other
outbreaks in the US. The patient is currently being treated at the Cohen
Childrenâ€™s Medical Centre in Queens. As per the health officials, anyone who
visited the pediatric emergency department at the medical centre from March 3
to March 4 or visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit from March 3 to
March 6 could have been potentially exposed. (</span><span style='font-family:

In this example, because I have 2 events for the same "reported_location", United States, both entries will receive the same value, but "entry_number" would be "3a" and "3b", respectively.


3. Finally, the entries listed in the Research, Policies and Guidelines section of the HTML code would have the following format:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal;background:#5B9BD5'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;

advances in the treatment of <b>malaria</b>, with researchers discovering that
modified forms of the antibiotic fosmidomycin, known as lipophilic diester
prodrugs, have increased efficacy against malaria compared to the original
drug. This improved efficacy is achieved through the prodrug approach, which
involves chemical modification to enhance the absorption and distribution of
the drug prior to conversion to its active form. The study identifies
acylpeptide hydrolase, an enzyme found in human red blood cells, as the key
activator of these prodrugs. Remarkably, the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium
falciparum</i> uses this human enzyme to activate the drug in itself. This
finding suggests a potential reduction in drug resistance, as the activation
relies on a human enzyme rather than the parasite's own, which is typically
involved in resistance through mutations. The discovery offers new insights
into the development of antimalarial treatments that are less prone to
resistance, thereby improving treatment efficacy. (</span><span

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>) </span></p>

In this example, in the first paragraph tag the "summary_title" will receive "Prodrug activation in malaria parasites mediated by an imported erythrocyte esterase, acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH)" and the "reported_location" will receive "United States"

The title can also be attributed to regions, consider these examples:

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;
text-indent:-18.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>Syndromic screening for infection prevention and control measures
during public health emergencies, Worldwide</span></b></p>

In the example above "summary_title" will receive "Syndromic screening for infection prevention and control measures
during public health emergencies" and the "reported_location" will be "Worldwide".
