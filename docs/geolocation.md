This code implements a **Streamlit web application** for exploring and reporting on geolocations, specifically countries and their associated regions/continents, using a curated geolocation database. The app is designed to help users select countries, view their metadata, and generate standardized reporting language for affected areas, supporting consistent reporting in public health or similar domains.

## Entry point code

```bash
/home/fernando/OpsToolKit/legacy_code/opstoolkit/src/geolocations/geolocations.py
```

## High-Level Functionality

1. **Authentication**  
    The app checks user authentication at startup using a custom `check_authentication()` function, ensuring only authorized users can access the tool.
    
2. **Data Loading**
    
    - Loads a geolocation database (`geolocations_db.tsv`) containing country names, regions, and continents.
    - The database is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame via the `load_geolocation_db()` function.
3. **User Interface**
    - Custom CSS is injected to improve the appearance of the multi-select dropdown.
    
4. **Country Selection**
    
    - Users can select one or more countries from a multi-select dropdown populated with all country names from the database.
    - The selected countries are stored in the Streamlit session state for persistence.
5. **Display of Selected Countries**
    
    - When countries are selected, a filtered table is shown with metadata for those countries.
    - The table is displayed using Streamlit’s `st.data_editor` for interactive exploration.
6. **Reporting Logic**
    
    - When the user clicks the "Locate" button:
        - The app determines how to report the selected area(s) using the `determine_area_attribution()` function (e.g., whether to refer to a region, continent, or list of countries).
        - It also formats a string listing the affected locations using `format_affected_locations()`.
        - Both the reporting string and affected locations are displayed in a styled format for easy copying into reports.

## Key Functions and Components

- **load_geolocation_db**:  
    Loads the geolocation database from a TSV file into a DataFrame.
    
- **determine_area_attribution**:  
    Determines the appropriate reporting language for the selected countries (e.g., "Europe", "South America", or a list of countries), supporting standardized reporting.
    
- **format_affected_locations**:  
    Formats the list of selected countries into a string suitable for inclusion in reports.
    
- **display_geolocation_help**:  
    Displays help/documentation for the app.
    
- **get_translation**:  
    Provides localized strings for UI elements.

## Typical User Workflow

1. **User logs in** (authentication enforced).
2. **User selects one or more countries** from the dropdown.
3. **App displays a table** with metadata for the selected countries.
4. **User clicks the "Locate" button** to generate reporting language.
5. **App displays standardized reporting text** for the selected area(s) and a formatted list of affected locations.
6. **User can copy the generated text** for use in reports or communications.

## Intended Use Case

This tool is intended for analysts, epidemiologists, or public health professionals who need to:

- Quickly look up country/region/continent groupings.
- Generate standardized, consistent language for reporting affected areas in daily or situational reports.
- Ensure that country names and groupings are consistent with organizational standards (e.g., using UN M49 regions).

## Summary

**In summary:**  
This code provides an interactive, authenticated web app for selecting countries, viewing their metadata, and generating standardized reporting language for affected areas, all based on a curated geolocation database. It supports localization, session management, and is designed for use in environments where consistent geographic reporting is critical.
