# OpsToolKit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-Based Architecture

Web applications MUST be built using modular, reusable components that follow these rules:

- Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Components MUST be independently testable and documented
- Shared components live in a common library with versioned contracts
- Component APIs MUST be stable; breaking changes require major version bump
- No direct coupling between components; use dependency injection or event-driven patterns

**Rationale**: Modular architecture enables parallel development, easier testing, and long-term maintainability. Component reuse reduces code duplication and ensures consistency across the application.

### II. AI Agent Integration Standards

All AI agent integrations for data and text processing MUST adhere to:

- Standardized input/output contracts using typed interfaces
- Error handling with graceful degradation (fallback strategies required)
- Streaming support for long-running operations with progress indicators
- Rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Audit logging for all AI operations (input, output, tokens, latency, errors)
- Clear separation between agent orchestration logic and business logic

**Rationale**: AI agents introduce non-determinism and latency. Standardized patterns ensure predictable behavior, debuggability, and user trust through transparency.

### III. Database Management Excellence

Database operations MUST follow these non-negotiable practices:

- Schema migrations MUST be versioned, reversible, and tested before production
- All queries MUST use parameterized statements (no string concatenation)
- Database connections MUST use connection pooling with configurable limits
- Indexes MUST be created for all frequently queried fields
- Transactions MUST be used for multi-step operations to ensure data integrity
- Database credentials MUST be stored in secure vaults, never in code or version control
- Regular backup verification (restore tests) MUST be performed

**Rationale**: Data integrity is paramount. Poor database practices lead to security vulnerabilities, data corruption, and performance degradation.

### IV. Code Quality & Maintainability

All code MUST meet these quality standards:

- TypeScript/typed language preferred; dynamic types require explicit justification
- Unit test coverage MUST be ≥80% for business logic and critical paths
- Integration tests MUST cover all API endpoints and database operations
- Code reviews MUST be completed before merge (minimum 1 approver)
- Linting and formatting MUST be enforced via pre-commit hooks
- Complexity metrics: functions >50 lines or cyclomatic complexity >10 require refactoring
- Documentation MUST include: API contracts, architecture decisions (ADRs), deployment guides

**Rationale**: Code is read more often than written. Quality standards reduce technical debt and onboarding time.

### V. User Experience Consistency

User interfaces MUST provide consistent, accessible experiences:

- Design system with reusable UI components (buttons, forms, modals, etc.)
- Responsive design MUST support mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance (minimum)
- Loading states MUST be shown for operations >200ms
- Error messages MUST be user-friendly with actionable guidance
- Keyboard navigation MUST be fully supported
- Performance: Time to Interactive (TTI) <3s on 3G networks

**Rationale**: Inconsistent UX confuses users and increases support burden. Accessibility is both ethical and often legally required.

## Performance & Security Requirements

### Performance Standards

Applications MUST meet these performance benchmarks:

- API response time: p95 <500ms for read operations, <1s for write operations
- Database queries: p95 <100ms; queries >1s require optimization or caching
- Frontend bundle size: <500KB initial load (gzipped)
- Lazy loading MUST be used for routes and heavy components
- Caching strategy MUST be documented and implemented (browser, CDN, server-side)
- Performance monitoring MUST be in place (metrics, alerts for degradation)

### Security Standards

Security MUST be embedded at every layer:

- Authentication MUST use industry-standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, or JWT)
- Authorization MUST follow principle of least privilege with role-based access control
- All API endpoints MUST validate and sanitize inputs
- HTTPS MUST be enforced; HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- Secrets rotation policy MUST be documented and automated
- Dependency vulnerability scanning MUST run on every build
- Security headers MUST be configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

**Rationale**: Performance impacts user satisfaction and business metrics. Security breaches damage trust and can have legal consequences.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

### Testing Requirements

Test-first development is strongly encouraged:

- Write tests for new features before implementation when possible
- All bug fixes MUST include regression tests
- Integration tests MUST run in CI/CD pipeline before deployment
- End-to-end tests MUST cover critical user journeys
- Performance tests MUST run before major releases

### Code Review & Deployment

Quality gates before production deployment:

- All code changes require pull request with passing CI checks
- Code reviews MUST verify: functionality, tests, security, performance impact
- Staging environment MUST mirror production configuration
- Database migrations MUST be tested in staging before production
- Rollback plan MUST be documented for each deployment
- Production deployments MUST be approved by at least one team lead

### Documentation Requirements

Documentation is not optional:

- README MUST explain: purpose, setup, development workflow, deployment process
- API documentation MUST be auto-generated from code annotations
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) MUST be created for significant design choices
- Runbooks MUST exist for operational procedures (deployment, rollback, monitoring)

**Rationale**: Structured workflows prevent errors, ensure quality, and enable team scalability. Documentation enables onboarding and reduces dependency on individual knowledge.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines.

**Amendment Process**:
- Amendments require written proposal with rationale and impact analysis
- Amendments MUST be reviewed by all active contributors
- Approval requires consensus or 2/3 majority vote
- All amendments MUST include migration plan for existing code

**Compliance**:
- All pull requests MUST be verified for constitutional compliance
- Exceptions require explicit justification and time-bound remediation plan
- Quarterly constitution reviews to ensure relevance and effectiveness

**Enforcement**:
- Automated tooling MUST enforce mechanical rules (linting, coverage, security scans)
- Code reviews MUST verify adherence to architectural principles
- Regular audits of compliance status with remediation tracking

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-22 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-22
